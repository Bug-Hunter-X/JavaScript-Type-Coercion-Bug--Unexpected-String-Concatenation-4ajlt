This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to type coercion. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, it performs string concatenation when one of the arguments is a string. The solution illustrates how to explicitly check types or use a safer approach to avoid this issue.  This type of error can cause unexpected results in calculations and comparisons.
